# What's Included

The default installation of Unified Remote Server includes a set of bundled remotes.
If you are using a portable version of the server then the remotes will be located next to the executable.

Note that you should not make changes in the bundled remotes (or place new remotes in the bundled directory) as these changes will be overwritten when the server
gets updated. You should instead place new remotes in the ``Custom`` directory.
