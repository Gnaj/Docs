# Debugging

First of all, it is a good idea to use a text editor that supports syntax highlighting when creating your remotes.
This is useful to catch syntax errors in your script or layout files as early as possible. Recommended editors:

* [Notepad++ (Windows)](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
* [Sublime Text (Mac OS X)](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

You can use the web manager's log page to debug and troubleshoot your remotes. Access the manager using your browser at
[http://localhost:9510/web](http://localhost:9510/web). Change ``localhost`` to your server's IP if you are not on the
same machine as the server.
